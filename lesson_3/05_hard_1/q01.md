# JS101 Lesson 3
## Practice Problems: Hard 1
### Question 1

Will the following functions return the same results?

```js
function first() {
  return {
    prop1: "hi there"
  };
}

function second() {
  return
  {
    prop1: "hi there"
  };
}

console.log(first());
console.log(second());
```

### Solution:
No, `second()` returns `undefined`, and the code following `return` never
executes. JavaScript inserts semicolons where it thinks they're needed, and it
actually inserts one immediately following `return`, making it a separate
statement from the object literal beginning on the next line.
