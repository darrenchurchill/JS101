# JS101 Lesson 3
## Practice Problems: Hard 1
### Question 1

Will the following functions return the same results?

```js
function first() {
  return {
    prop1: "hi there"
  };
}

function second() {
  return
  {
    prop1: "hi there"
  };
}

console.log(first());
console.log(second());
```

### Solution:
Yes, the functions will return objects with the same property, `prop1`, with the
same value, `"hi there"`.

Although `second()`'s code isn't common style in JavaScript, it's still
syntactically correct.
