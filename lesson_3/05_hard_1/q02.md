# JS101 Lesson 3
## Practice Problems: Hard 1
### Question 2

What does the last line in the following code output?

```js
let object = { first: [1] };
let numArray = object["first"];
numArray.push(2);

console.log(numArray);  // => "[1, 2]"
console.log(object);
```

### Solution:
On line 2, `numArray` is initialized with a reference to `object["first"]`'s
array. `numArray.push(2)` modifies that array, by appending the value `2` to it.

Therefore, `console.log(object)` logs `{ first: [1, 2] }` to the console.
`object` has been mutated.
