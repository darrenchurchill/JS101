# JS101 Lesson 3
## Practice Problems: Hard 1
### Question 3

Given the following similar sets of code, what will each snippet print?

A)
```js
function messWithVars(one, two, three) {
  one = two;
  two = three;
  three = one;
}

let one = ["one"];
let two = ["two"];
let three = ["three"];

messWithVars(one, two, three);

console.log(`one is: ${one}`);
console.log(`two is: ${two}`);
console.log(`three is: ${three}`);
```
### Solution A:
This snippet logs:
```
one is: [ 'one' ]
two is: [ 'two' ]
three is: [ 'three' ]
```

In the above code, the global variables `one`, `two`, and `three` are
initialized with references to arrays. When `messWithVars(one, two, three)` is
invoked on line 11, these arrays are passed by reference.

However, `messWithVars`'s parameters, `one`, `two` and `three` shadow the global
variables, making them inaccessible in the function scope. The function's
assignment statements do not modify the original arrays, so the global variables
`one`, `two`, and `three`'s arrays remain unchanged after the function call.

B)
```js
function messWithVars(one, two, three) {
  one = ["two"];
  two = ["three"];
  three = ["one"];
}

let one = ["one"];
let two = ["two"];
let three = ["three"];

messWithVars(one, two, three);

console.log(`one is: ${one}`);
console.log(`two is: ${two}`);
console.log(`three is: ${three}`);
```
### Solution B:
This snippet logs:
```
one is: [ 'one' ]
two is: [ 'two' ]
three is: [ 'three' ]
```

As in example A, the arguments to `messWithVars` are passed by reference, but
reassigning each parameter's value inside the function body has no effect on the
argument's arrays after the function call.

C)
```js
function messWithVars(one, two, three) {
  one.splice(0, 1, "two");
  two.splice(0, 1, "three");
  three.splice(0, 1, "one");
}

let one = ["one"];
let two = ["two"];
let three = ["three"];

messWithVars(one, two, three);

console.log(`one is: ${one}`);
console.log(`two is: ${two}`);
console.log(`three is: ${three}`);
```
### Solution C:
This snippet logs:
```
one is: [ 'two' ]
two is: [ 'three' ]
three is: [ 'one' ]
```

Unlike example A and B, the `messWithVars` function in this example modifies the
arrays referenced by its three parameters. Therefore, after the function call,
the global variables' `one`, `two`, and `three`'s arrays have been mutated.
