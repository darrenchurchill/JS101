### Question 6

What do you think the following code will output?

__Bonus:__ How can you reliably test if a value is `NaN`?

```js
let nanArray = [NaN];

console.log(nanArray[0] === NaN]);
```

### Solution:
In JavaScript, `NaN` is the only value that does not evaluate equal to itself.
Therefore, the code above logs `false` to the console.

You can test whether a value is `NaN` by using `Number.isNaN()`.
