### Question 8

One day, Spot was playing with the Munster family's home computer, and he wrote
a small program to mess with their demographic data:

```js
let munsters = {
  Herman: { age: 32, gender: "male" },
  Lily: { age: 30, gender: "female" },
  Grandpa: { age: 402, gender: "male" },
  Eddie: { age: 10, gender: "male" },
  Marilyn: { age: 23, gender: "female" }
}

function messWithDemographics(demoObject) {
  Object.values(demoObject).forEach(familyMember => {
    familyMember["age"] += 42;
    familyMember["gender"] = "other";
  });
}
```

After writing the function, he typed the following code:
```js
messWithDemographics(munsters);
```

Did the family's data get ransacked? Why or why not?

### Solution:
Yes, the data gets modified after `messWithDemographics(munsters)` is invoked.
This is an example of a function with side-effects. It modifies the object
passed in as an argument.

The `munsters` object is passed by reference in the function call, so the
`demoObject` parameter references the same object. Any changes made to the
object using the `demoObject` reference inside the function call will persist
after the function call.
