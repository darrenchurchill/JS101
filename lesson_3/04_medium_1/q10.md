# JS101 Lesson 3
## Practice Problems: Medium 1
### Question 10

Consider the following two functions:

```js
function foo(param = "no") {
  return "yes";
}

function bar(param = "no") {
  return param === "no" ? "yes" : "no";
}
```

What will the following invocation return?
```js
bar(foo());
```

### Solution:
Nested function calls are evaluated inner-most first.

The composition of function calls will return `bar("yes")` -> `"no"`.
