### Question 4

Alyssa was asked to write an implementation of a rolling buffer. You can add and
remove elements from a rolling buffer. However, once the buffer becomes full,
any new elements will displace the oldest elements in the buffer.

She wrote two implementations of the code for adding elements to the buffer. In
presenting the code to her team leader, she said "Take your pick. Do you prefer
`push()` or `concat()` for modifying the buffer?".

Is there a difference between these implementations, other than the method she
used to add an element to the buffer? You may assume that `newElement` will
always be a primitive value.

```js
function addToRollingBuffer1(buffer, maxBufferSize, newElement) {
  buffer.push(newElement);
  if (buffer.length > maxBufferSize) {
    buffer.shift();
  }
  return buffer;
}

function addToRollingBuffer2(buffer, maxBufferSize, newElement) {
  buffer = buffer.concat(newElement);
  if (buffer.length > maxBufferSize) {
    buffer.shift();
  }
  return buffer;
}
```

### Solution:
Yes, there is a difference between the 2 implementations. `buffer` is passed by
reference to both functions, and `push` modifies the array it's called on. This
means, outside the scope of `addToRollingBuffer1` the `buffer` argument is
modified after the function call. `concat` returns a new array, and `buffer` is
reassigned, so `addToRollingBuffer2` doesn't modify the `buffer` argument
outside the function scope.
