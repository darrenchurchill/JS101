### Question 7

What will the following code output?

```js
let answer = 42;

function messWithIt(someNumber) {
  return (someNumber += 8);
}

let newAnswer = messWithIt(answer);

console.log(answer - 8);
```

### Solution:
The code will log `34` to the console.

We're concerned with `answer`'s value on line 9. It gets initialized with the
value `42` on line 1. Invoking `messWithIt` does not affect `answer`'s value.
`answer` holds a primitive value, which is passed by value to the function call.
Nothing inside `messWithIt`'s body will affect `answer`'s value.

Therefore, the `console.log` call on line 9 logs the expression `42 - 8`'s
value, `34`, to the console.
