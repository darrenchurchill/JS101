### Question 3

Alan wrote the following function, which was intended to return all of the
factors of `number`:

```js
function factors(number) {
  let divisor = number;
  let factors = [];
  do {
    if (number % divisor === 0) {
      factors.push(number / divisor);
    }
    divisor -= 1;
  } while (divisor !== 0);
  return factors;
}
```

Alyssa noticed that this code would fail when the input is `0` or a negative
number, and asked Alan to change the loop. How can he make this work without
using a `do/while loop`? Note that we're not looking to find the factors for `0`
or negative numbers, but we want to handle it gracefully instead of raising an
exception or going into an infinite loop.

__Bonus__: What is the purpose of `number % divisor === 0` in the code?

### Solution:
Alan can make this code work by changing the loop to a `while` loop, and
changing the control conditional to `divisor > 0`. This way, the loop won't
execute if `number` is zero or a negative number.

```js
function factors(number) {
  let divisor = number;
  let factors = [];
  while (divisor > 0) {
    if (number % divisor === 0) {
      factors.push(number / divisor);
    }
    divisor -= 1;
  }
  return factors;
}
```

The purpose of `number % divisor === 0` in the code is to determine if `divisor`
goes into `number` a whole number of times. If it does, then we found a factor.
