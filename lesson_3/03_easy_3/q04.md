# JS101 Lesson 3
## Practice Problems: Easy 3
### Question 4

What will the following code output?

```js
let arr1 = [{ first: "value1" }, { second: "value2" }, 3, 4, 5];
let arr2 = arr1.slice();
arr2[0].first = 42;
console.log(arr1);
```

### Solution:
The code outputs `[{ first: 42 }, { second: "value2" }, 3, 4, 5]` to the
console.

On line 2, `arr2` is initialized with `arr1.slice()`'s return value, a shallow
copy of `arr1`'s array. Any of a shallow copy's properties holding references to
objects share those references with the source object. Properties having
primitive values get new copies of those values.

After line 2 executes, `arr1` and `arr2` reference their own separate arrays,
but the values at their `0` and `1` indexes reference the same objects.
Therefore, on line 3, when `arr2`'s first object's `first` property is changed,
so is `arr1`'s first object's `first` property. They are the same object in
memory.
