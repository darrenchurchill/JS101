# JS101 Lesson 3
## Practice Problems: Easy 3
### Question 3

What will the following code output?

```js
let str1 = "hello there";
let str2 = str1;
str2 = "goodbye!";
console.log(str1);
```

### Solution:
The code logs `hello there` to the console.

Strings are primitive immutable values in JavaScript. On the second line, `str2`
is initialized with `str1`'s value, a new string, `"hello there"`. Reassigning
`str2`'s value to a new string on the third line still doesn't affect `str1`'s
value.
