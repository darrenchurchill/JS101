# JS101 Lesson 3
## Practice Problems: Easy 3
### Question 2

What will the following code output?

```js
console.log([1, 2, 3] + [4, 5]);
```

### Solution:
The code logs the string `'1,2,34,5'` to the console. In JavaScript, array's
don't support the `+` operator, so the two arrays are coerced into strings
before being concatenated together.
