# JS101 Lesson 3
## Practice Problems: Easy 1
### Question 1

Will the code below raise an error?

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers[6] = 5;
```

### Solution:
No, in JavaScript, this code will not raise an error. The array will have empty
slots at indexes `4`, `4`, and `5`.


### Bonus Question

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers[6] = 5;
numbers[4];  // what will this line return?
```

### Bonus Solution:
`numbers[4]` outputs `undefined`, but the array slot is still empty. It doesn't
technically have a value. An empty slot in an array is different from an array
index with a value `undefined`.
