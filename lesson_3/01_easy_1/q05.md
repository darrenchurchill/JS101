### Question 5

What will the following code output?

```js
console.log(false == '0');
console.log(false === '0');
```

### Solution:
`==` is the loose equality operator, whereas `===` is the strict equality operator.

In the first expression, the two operands are not the same type, so JavaScript's
type coercion rules apply. First the boolean value, `false` is converted to the
number `0`. Then, because the operands are still not the same type, the string
`'0'` is converted to a number. After type coercion, `0` is equal to `0`, so
the expression evaluates to `true`. Implicit type coercions are tricky and you
should usually avoid them.

In the second expression, the two operands are not the same type, which is a
requirement of the strict equality operator. Because the operands are not the
same type, the expression evaluates to `false`.
